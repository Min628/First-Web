<h2>Black Holes<hr></<hr></h2><body>A sufficiently intense gravitational field can prevent the escape not only of matter, but even of light to create an entity known as black holes, where regions of enormous mass compressed into a small space produce such gravitational fields.</body>
<p><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/k-4/stories/nasa-knows/what-is-a-black-hole-k4.html" target="_blank" title="Black Holes">Black holes</a> can (and some do) contain very large amounts of matter—millions or billions of times the mass of the sun—but may be formed by even a small amount of matter sufficiently compressed.</p>
<h2><p>BACKGROUND AND SCIENTIFIC FOUNDATIONS</P></h2>
<img src="Black Hole.jpg" width="100%">
<p style="margin-top:30px;">According to general relativity, the path taken by a beam of light is the shortest distance between two points; such a path is called a geodesic. Furthermore, gravity warps space, bending geodesics; the stronger a gravitational field is in a certain region, the more bent the geodesics are in that region. Within a certain radius of a black hole, all geodesics are so warped that a photon of light cannot escape to another part of the universe. Essentially, there are no straight lines connecting any point that is within a certain radius of a black hole (which, in theory, means there is no dimension) to any point that is farther away. The spherical surface defined by this radius is termed the event horizon of the black hole because events inside the event horizon can have no effect on events outside it and whatever is inside the event horizon is sealed off forever from the space-time of outside observers.</br>
The event horizon, thus, imposes a form of censorship on the makeup of a black hole; the only properties of a black hole that can be ascertained from the outside are its mass, net charge, and rate of spin. No internal time-dependent processes can be detected in the external environment, for that would involve sending signals from inside the black hole to the outside—which is impossible, for not even light can escape. This censorship, or inability to produce information from within the black hole, is what is responsible for the fewness of a black hole's measurable properties: mass, spin, and charge.
